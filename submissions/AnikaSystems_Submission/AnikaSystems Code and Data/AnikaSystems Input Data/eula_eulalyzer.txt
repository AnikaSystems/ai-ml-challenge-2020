Please read this document carefully.  This is the Software Licensing Agreement (the "Agreement") pursuant to which you (the “LICENSEE”) may download, install and use the software and associated documentation files identified above (the "SOFTWARE PACKAGE"). Unless otherwise specified, “you” shall mean you and, as applicable, your company, organization or employer for whom you are acting in installing and/or using the SOFTWARE PACKAGE.  Installation and use of the SOFTWARE PACKAGE is absolutely conditioned upon your acceptance and assent to the terms and conditions contained herein.  This Agreement cannot be waived, varied, modified or amended in any manner except in writing by BrightFort LLC (the “LICENSOR”). Any portion deemed invalid or unenforceable shall be struck and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue to be effective and binding.  

IF YOU CANNOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE BUTTON INDICATING NON-ACCEPTANCE MUST BE SELECTED AND YOU MUST NOT PROCEED WITH INSTALLATION AND/OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE.


FREEWARE USE: 

The Personal version of the SOFTWARE PACKAGE is licensed as freeware to FREEWARE LICENSEES only.  As used herein "FREEWARE LICENSEES" shall be LICENSEES who are individuals or not-for-profit organizations using the SOFTWARE PACKAGE for their own personal or educational use on individual personal computer workstations. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, LICENSOR hereby grants and FREEWARE LICENSEE hereby accepts a non-exclusive, non-transferable, annual and renewable right and license to install and use the SOFTWARE PACKAGE on one workstation. This right and license includes the opportunity to purchase access to the “Pro” version for the individual workstation as described in "1. General License Terms and Conditions" below. 

All other uses and users not expressly described above as FREEWARE LICENSEES must purchase “Pro” version licenses as described in “3. Pro Licenses and Required License Verification” below. Use of this SOFTWARE PACKAGE without an appropriate license is prohibited.  


1.	General License Terms and Conditions: 
 
By installing and using the SOFTWARE PACKAGE and/or each time you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are stating to LICENSOR that you personally: (i) are either acting on your own behalf as an individual or (ii) have been authorized by your employer or principal to enter into this Agreement as binding on your employer or principal and all end-users for such LICENSEE entity. 

LICENSEE shall use the SOFTWARE PACKAGE solely for LICENSEE's internal use and shall not allow access by or the use of the SOFTWARE PACKAGE for the benefit, direct or indirect, of any third party.  LICENSEE may not assign either this Agreement or the license granted herein.  The SOFTWARE PACKAGE may not be disclosed, sublicensed, published, released, or transferred to another party by LICENSEE, without the prior written consent of LICENSOR.  No transfer of ownership is intended by this Agreement.  All rights not expressly granted to LICENSEE in this Agreement are reserved by LICENSOR.

Without the LICENSOR's prior written consent, LICENSEE may not: (1) Modify or create any derivative works of the SOFTWARE PACKAGE or its components; (2) Decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, reduce the SOFTWARE PACKAGE to perceptible form, or otherwise attempt to learn the source code, structure, algorithms or ideas underlying the SOFTWARE PACKAGE (except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction); (3) Sell, resell, distribute, redistribute, or otherwise make available the SOFTWARE PACKAGE or components thereof, or this license, in any way; (4) Repackage or bundle the SOFTWARE PACKAGE with other software; or (5) Remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in the SOFTWARE PACKAGE.

The SOFTWARE PACKAGE is only available as a standalone software application. Installing the SOFTWARE PACKAGE through any means other than a user-initiated and user-operated session of the stand-alone installer as provided by LICENSOR is in violation of this License, may subject the LICENSEE to penalties under the law, and may expose the LICENSEE’s computer systems to unnecessary risks not in LICENSOR's control. LICENSOR will not be liable for any damages or liabilities that may result if LICENSEE installs the SOFTWARE PACKAGE in an unauthorized manner or from unauthorized sources.

LICENSEE may utilize the services of a knowledgeable individual to assist LICENSEE in the installation of the SOFTWARE PACKAGE, as long as such knowledgeable third party is providing such services on a workstation-by-workstation basis (as opposed to providing bulk automated or remote assistance in violation of the installer usage requirements set forth above) and the SOFTWARE PACKAGE is installed in its original form without enhancements or alterations as a standalone software application with no files/features added/removed, and as long as no fee has been charged for the SOFTWARE PACKAGE or for its use beyond what is outlined in this LICENSE.

Any rights that are not expressly granted by this Agreement shall not be implied and are reserved by the LICENSOR. The license granted pursuant to this Agreement authorizes or permits only the use of the SOFTWARE PACKAGE that is expressly provided herein. No transfer of ownership is intended by this Agreement.

3.	Pro Licenses and Required License Verification:

Time limited licenses to Pro version functionality may be purchased separately from LICENSOR or its authorized agents.  This "Pro version" functionality is included in the relevant SOFTWARE PACKAGE, but is disabled and may be enabled/unlocked only with the input of unlock key(s) to be provided with your payment of a non-refundable license fee. Ownership and title of the SOFTWARE PACKAGE license key(s) is retained by LICENSOR. You may not sell, transfer, publish, distribute, or otherwise give anyone SOFTWARE PACKAGE license key(s). LICENSOR reserves the right to terminate license key(s) for noncompliance with this license agreement upon LICENSOR's discretion.

Access to LICENSOR's Pro functionality, when purchased, is authorized solely for one (1) machine on which the SOFTWARE PACKAGE is installed, per unique license key.  To verify the Pro license's status, LICENSEE will be required to proceed through an online license verification process before the Pro functionality is enabled.  During license verification, LICENSEE will provide the Pro license information (including the license key) and computer configuration in the form of an alphanumeric code over the Internet to verify the authenticity of the Software.  Such authorization is not transferable to any other machine and licenses for Pro functionality must be purchased for each computer on which the SOFTWARE PACKAGE with Pro functionality is to be executed. In the event that LICENSEE is not able to verify the Pro license over the Internet, or through any other method specified during the license verification process, LICENSEE may contact EULAlyzer Pro Support using the information provided by LICENSOR during license verification, or as may be set forth in the documentation. Pro licenses do not automatically renew, but may be renewed by LICENSEE with payment of applicable, non-refundable license fees.

4.	Proprietary Property:

You acknowledge that the SOFTWARE PACKAGE constitutes valuable proprietary assets and trade secrets of LICENSOR and that any additional information, written materials, documents, flow charts, logic diagrams, source code, test materials, and the like relating in any way to the SOFTWARE PACKAGE are also proprietary to LICENSOR.  LICENSOR holds and shall hold sole and exclusive ownership of all right, title, and interest in any patent, trademark, or copyright secured for the SOFTWARE PACKAGE, subject only to the rights and privileges expressly granted to the you in this Agreement.  You agree to use the SOFTWARE PACKAGE only as provided in this Agreement.   You further agree to protect the SOFTWARE PACKAGE and any additional information, written materials, flow charts, logic diagrams, source code, test materials, and the like relating in any way to the SOFTWARE PACKAGE from unauthorized disclosure by your agents, employees, or customers, if any.  

5.	Limited Permission to Copy:

If you wish to mirror this SOFTWARE PACKAGE, or include it on any compilation medium, you must request permission from LICENSOR by sending an e-mail to the address listed on the Contact page of www.brightfort.com. You may NOT include this SOFTWARE PACKAGE on any compilation mediums where you charge more than the cost of the medium itself (i.e. you may not charge for this SOFTWARE PACKAGE, but you may recoup the cost of the CD-ROM or other media it is placed on).  ALL FILES MUST REMAIN UNCHANGED AND INTACT, AND NO FILES MAY BE ADDED TO THIS DISTRIBUTION.
 
6.	Indemnification:
 
LICENSEE agrees to indemnify and hold harmless LICENSOR, its directors, officers, agents and employees, for all claims relating to the SOFTWARE PACKAGE, including, but not limited to LICENSOR technical support or updates or enhancements to the SOFTWARE PACKAGE, including causes of action sounding in contract, tort, or strict liability, brought against the LICENSOR by virtue of LICENSOR’S supplying the SOFTWARE PACKAGE to the LICENSEE.
