5.           LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
 
DERIVATIVE WILL ONLY BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT DAMAGES, SUBJECT TO SECTION 6. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL DERIVATIVE BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST OR DAMAGED DATA, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE DOWNLOAD, INSTALLATION OR USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE PRODUCTS OR ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS OR THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF DERIVATIVE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE.
Licensee agrees that the maximum aggregate liability of Derivative and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives for all claims under any and all circumstances relating to the Products under all theories of liability will be limited to the fees paid to Derivative by Licensee in respect of the particular Software license(s)/product key(s) relating to the installations giving rise to such liability in the six (6) month period preceding the claim in respect of such liability.
 
6.           ESSENTIAL TERMS
 
The disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability and monetary cap on monetary damages in sections 4, 5 and 6 constitute an essential part of this Agreement. A fundamental breach or breach of a fundamental term of this Agreement by Derivative shall not limit the intended effect of sections 4, 5 and 6 or any other provision of this Agreement which is intended to limit Derivative’s liability. Licensee acknowledges that, but for the disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability and monetary cap on damages, Derivative would not enter into this Agreement.
 
7.           SUPPORT
 
Except for certain license types of the Software where Derivative has expressly stated on the website include a certain amount of support services such as TouchDesigner Pro,  support services for the Products are to be separately arranged between the Licensee and Derivative and may be purchased separately as required by Licensee.
 
8.           CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
 
The Products incorporate trade secrets and constitute the confidential information of Derivative and its licensors and Licensee shall use all reasonable efforts (and in any event, efforts that are no less than those used by Licensee to protect its own confidential information) to protect such aspects of the Products from disclosure.
 
9.         TERMINATION
 
This Agreement, and accordingly, Licensee’s license to use the Products, shall terminate upon the earlier of: (i) the term of Licensee’s license, if any; or (ii) failure by Licensee to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement. Upon receipt by Licensee of written notice by Derivative of the termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall immediately stop using the Products and destroy (including, with respect to electronic copies, permanently delete) all copies of the Products in Licensee’s possession or control and provide Derivative, upon request, with written confirmation of such destruction. All sections of this Agreement, other than section 1, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
 
10.         ASSIGNMENT
 
Derivative may, at any time, without Licensee’s consent, assign this Agreement, or any of its rights hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party.
Licensee may only assign this Agreement, or any of its rights hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party, with the prior written consent of Derivative. If Licensee is a developer that is creating work product for a third party and bundling its work product with the Software, Licensee acknowledges that the third party must obtain a license to use the Products. If Licensee intends to assign this Agreement to the end user upon the completion of the work product, Licensee agrees that the assignment of this Agreement shall be done on the terms of Derivative’s form of assignment of license agreement or by e-mail, at Derivative’s sole discretion, and may be subject to an additional transfer fee as determined by Derivative, in its sole discretion. Derivative will indicate its consent of the requested assignment by signing the form of assignment of license agreement or if such request was sent by e-mail, will indicate its rejection or its consent in its response to Licensee’s e-mail.
This Agreement shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon each of the Licensee and Derivative and their respective heirs, executors, successors, assigns, administrators and legal representatives, as applicable.
 
11.         EMBEDDED SOFTWARE
 
The Software includes open source software, which is distributed under and is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable open source software licenses and notices, as set out in Exhibit A to this Agreement. Derivative makes no representations or warranties, and there are no conditions, regarding the open source software.
 
12.         CERTIFICATION
 
Within ten (10) days of a request by Derivative, a senior officer, signing authority or other senior official of Licensee shall, after making due inquiry, certify in writing to Derivative, as applicable: (i) that Licensee (and each Licensee Affiliate, as applicable) is, and has continuously been, in full compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including all applicable restrictions and limitations on installation and use of the Software; or (ii) the extent to which Licensee (or each Licensee Affiliate, as applicable) is not, or has not been, in full compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including all applicable restrictions and limitations on the installation of Licenses and use of the Software. Licensee shall provide such supporting evidencing as Derivative may reasonably request. For certainty, failure to provide the certification as required by this Section is a material breach of this Agreement that entitles Derivative to terminate this Agreement and to any other remedies that may be available to Derivative at law or in equity.
 
13.         GOVERNING LAW
 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ontario and federal laws of Canada applicable therein and shall be treated, in all respects, as an Ontario contract. The parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ontario. The parties hereby expressly exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and any implementing legislation.
 
14.         ARBITRATION
 
Any controversy, dispute, or claim that is of a fundamental nature in relation to this Agreement (including the question whether any particular matter is arbitrable hereunder) will be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act of Ontario, 1991, SO 1991, c17  or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof (the “Act”) by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Act.  The arbitrator will sit in Toronto, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The determination resulting from the arbitration process will be final and binding upon the parties to the arbitration and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such decision may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction based on an error of law or as expressly provided under Section 46(1) of the Act. The Parties agree that the arbitrator shall have the power to award damages, injunctive relief and reasonable solicitors’ fees and expenses to either party in such arbitration; provided that this arbitration provision does not prevent either party from seeking interim injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction. If in a disputed matter a party desires a remedy that an arbitrator is unable by law to provide, that matter will be excluded from arbitration. The costs of the arbitration will be borne by the parties as may be specified in the arbitrator’s decision.
 
15.         MISCELLANEOUS

15.2.     Severability. In the event that one or more of the provisions of this Agreement are held to be illegal or unenforceable, this Agreement shall not be rendered inoperative but the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect, unless such illegal or unenforceable provisions are held to be a material part of this Agreement such that it may reasonably assumed that the parties would not have entered into this Agreement without such provisions in place.

No single or partial exercise of any such right shall preclude any other or further exercise of such right or the exercise of any other right.
15.4.     No Relationship. This Agreement shall not create or confer upon the parties hereto, in any way, or for any purpose, any relationship except that of contracting parties, and in particular does not create a partnership, a principal and agent, nor a joint venture between the Licensee and Derivative or an employer-employee relationship between Licensee and Derivative or any other persons rendering services to Derivative. All dealing by Derivative with its clients, creditors, suppliers, workmen, contractors, agents, employees, and other similar persons shall be conducted exclusively in Derivative’s name and Derivative shall not in any manner obligate Licensee on account thereof, and/or suggest to such persons that Licensee bears any obligation with respect to same.
